# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math function.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Print the coding to get the answer
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as md=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
### OUTPUT:
!['output'](/distance.png)

### RESULT:
Thus, the distance between two points is calculated.# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS
